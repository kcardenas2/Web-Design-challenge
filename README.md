# Web-Design-challenge
Had to create a web page using HTML

They provided the images and we had to use bootstrap to place the figures in a certain way.

Created a style.css to add to our html files to tell the database what we want it to do such placing headers, using nav bars, specifying what color background, padding, creating tables etc.
--
Then creating a data table with the data provided over 400 cities.
